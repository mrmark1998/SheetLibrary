I created this app to easily organize all of the PDF sheet music that I had cluttered up on my computer.  It is currently in the works, but the idea is to make it convenient to access my sheet music.  It was created using:
- Intellij IDE
- JavaFX
- SceneBuilder
- XAMPP server with Apache/MySQL

11/2/22
- Optimized the program's logic
- - Did extensive bug tracking and debugged many bugs from the program.
- Mainly added conditional clauses, but was able to clean up a lot of the code

11/1/22
- Created connections between client and server using Apache Commons Net FTP Protocol
- User can now Upload/Download/Open/Download PDF of any record 
- Program is mostly working but needs to be polished with some bugs here and there regarding SQL update

10/30-10/31/22 -
- Created app

Here are the implementation details that I would like the app to do in the future:
- Create a socket with an online server to upload PDFs and access all - done 11/1
- Be able to search and organize by Composer and Genre(make new column in SQL)
- Clean up GUI
