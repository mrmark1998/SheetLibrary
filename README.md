I created this app to easily organize all of the PDF sheet music that I had cluttered up on my computer.  It is currently in the works, but the idea is to make it convenient to access my sheet music.  It was created using:
- Intellij IDE
- JavaFX
- SceneBuilder
- XAMPP server with Apache/MySQL

10/30-10/31/22 -
- Created app 

Here are the implementation details that I would like the app to do in the future:
- Create a socket with an online server to upload PDFs and access all
- Be able to search and organize by Composer and Genre(make new column in SQL)
- Clean up GUI
